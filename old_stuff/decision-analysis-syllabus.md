### A simple example

\[…\]

The example highlights a process we will see many times:

  - A decision-maker selects one option from a menu of possible actions.
  - The decision-maker’s payoff from the choice depends both on the
    action taken, and on the state of the world.
  - The decision-maker may have some information about the state of the
    world, but maybe not perfect information.
  - Through collection and analysis of sample data, the decision-maker
    has an opportunity to sharpen her estimate of the true state of the
    world. Potentially, better information could yield a decision with
    higher payoffs.

### Definitions and formalism

#### States of nature

Let \(\theta\) denote the *state of nature* (or the true *state of the
world*).

Examples:

  - When …

Let \(\Theta\) denote the set of possible states of nature:
\(\theta \in \Theta\).

#### Actions

Statistical decision theory branches off from the main stem of
statistics here.

We suppose a decision-maker has a set of *actions* that can be taken.

Examples:

The action will be chosen from a menu of options called an *action set*
\(\mathcal{A}\).

Action sets may be discrete: e.g., \(\mathcal{A} = \{\)“apply
medication”, “don’t” \(\}\); or continuous: \(\mathcal{A} = \{\) a
range of possible dosage levels \(\}\).

In our formalism, the decision-maker typically will choose *exactly one*
action. If the decision-maker can perform multiple actions – say,
“install a solar panel *and* improve insulation” – we will represent
the action set as a list of ordered tuples. If the decision-maker has
the opton to do nothing, or to wait, this option will be listed
explicitly, as well.

#### Consequences of actions: *payoffs* or *lossess*

#### Uncertainy, beliefs, information

We represent the decision-maker’s beliefs (or *information*) as a
probability distribution (or *probability measure*) over \(\Theta\).

#### Lotteries
